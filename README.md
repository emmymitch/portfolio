<h1>Portfolio - Emily Mitcheson-Smith</h1>

<p>This website exists as a showcase for me and my work.</p>
<br>
<p>Languages used: HTML, CSS, SCSS, BEM</p>

<p>I approached this project by making 'chunks' at a time. For example, I wrote the HTML for the top navbar, then styled it. Then the same for the header, main, etc etc. I primarily used flex layout as I understand it best, however I used grid in my 'About' section to make sure I have a good understanding of that too.</p>
<p>The site was first designed for mobile, then scaled up using media queries. Additional minor queries were made in the scss to account for small layout styles which didn't quite work in the main boundaries.</p>
<p>The mobile hamburger menu was made entirely with HTML and SCSS; when I learn enough about javascript I will likely change it to this for cleaner code and responsiveness, however in the meantime I am quite proud I got it to work. Additionally, the 'Experience' and 'Interests' sections will become expandable.</p>
